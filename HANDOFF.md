## Current state — 2026-10-18
The continuation implemented the native Dock, Top Status Bar, Search, Settings, application lifecycle,
install library, launcher, updater and setup. A per-user **0.1.0-alpha.1** is installed: production setup
exit 0, Installed apps entry and launcher present, startup disabled, no automatic application launch.
This is a delivery observation, separate from the fake/temporary-root automated test policy.

The official public repository now exists at https://github.com/ibrahimbouillet/AetherShell.
The clean source is pushed and [Windows Release CI passed](https://github.com/ibrahimbouillet/AetherShell/actions/runs/39123368917) on
`4eed02879fb79aa60376e9b50c698b295bae163e`. The first [manual-install prerelease is public](https://github.com/ibrahimbouillet/AetherShell/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.1).
Its only assets are setup and checksums; no unsigned manifest, PDB or raw log is published.
Setup: 4,451,840 bytes; SHA-256 `edeafb8c89ca7c833b4b79dfbaee160267fd7278e3e0e91980f31df67fbb481f`.
The installed maintenance executable matches this exact CI package after a successful repair;
startup remains disabled and no application was automatically launched. The following documentation
receipt changes no product source and therefore does not rerun the same CI build. See S-012.
No live signed-update execution or complete Version 1 acceptance is claimed.

## NEXT SESSION START HERE
1. Read AGENTS, PROJECT_SPEC, TASKS and TEST_STATUS S-011. Code and executed evidence win over old
   work orders. Do not restart already implemented modules from historical "not started" notes.
2. Inspect Git status and remotes. **D18: original development checkout/history stays local.** Public
   development uses the separate `AetherShell-public` clean checkout with independent history and
   public GitHub noreply identity. Never push the original history or copy its .git, build/logs/PDBs,
   .local/.claude/.obsidian/graphs or owner `docs/Untitled.canvas`. The canvas remains untouched.
3. Inspect the published alpha and S-012 receipts, then continue outstanding qualification or
   owner-requested features. The first alpha is manual-install only. Future release publication
   follows AGENTS and current owner instructions; the production signature verifier has no bypass.
4. Continue the remaining manual/platform qualification in KNOWN_LIMITATIONS and TASKS. The complete
   Release /W4 /WX build and all 17 unit executables pass. Every integration executable has a passing
   scoped run; aggregate desktop runs also recorded capture-guard refusals and activation interference.
   A quiet interactive desktop is required. Never weaken capture guards to obtain a green result.
5. Preserve test isolation: temporary roots, fake launch/audio/startup operations, no real work-area
   changes. Captures need opaque guard bands, containment and foreign-overlap checks before/after.
   Only individually inspected synthetic-window assets in resources/screenshots are publishable.
6. Before packaging, run scripts/package.ps1 on current Release source. It rejects Debug/stale input
   and scans setup plus embedded payload bytes for private source paths, personal directories, machine names and CodeView paths.
   Old Debug artifacts contain private build paths and must never be exported.
7. Update TASKS for progress, DECISIONS/ADRs for decisions, TEST_STATUS for actual checks and this
   handoff when ending a session. Preserve requirement definitions and scoped-versus-full acceptance.

## Implemented corrections and evidence
- Status lifecycle: shared sessions, joins outside lifecycle locks, explicit terminal owned WinRT
  runtime cleanup (ADR0008), 60 cases. Weather expiry runs independently of blocked HTTP, 56 cases.
- Settings: UI-owned model/FIFO worker persistence (ADR0007), 33 unit + 5 native editor cases.
  Quit settles editor/startup work, freezes new mutations, then flushes. Cancelled quit restores input.
- Search: 7 unit + 5 native UI cases; Release 2000-app p95 0.601 ms, 5000-app p95 1.962 ms in the
  recorded run. Native EDIT supplies selection/clipboard semantics; actual IME remains unqualified.
- Dock: 14 unit + 2 native cases; Top Bar: 7 + 2. UIA, keyboard, finite/reduced-motion transitions,
  update badge, glyphs, drag/hit testing and safe dark/light synthetic assets exist.
- Install library: 10 unit + 7 isolated integration cases. Setup: 5 native cases, including maintenance
  relocation and constrained DPI viewport. App: 3 CLI + 1 isolated lifecycle/health/channel case.
- Updates: 101 unit cases, including persisted skipped-version clearing. App updater handoff has a
  duplicate guard and observer established before launch, with shared completion surviving failed
  dispatcher delivery. This handoff is source-reviewed; its live signed-release cycle is unqualified.
- Release tooling: 32 Python cases pass. Public candidate review: 457 files, source attribution and
  Markdown link/requirement consistency checked. Final Release binaries/payload pass privacy audit.

## Remaining qualification
Windows 10/ARM64, physical monitor/DPI/removal, real AppBar/full-screen/Explorer restart, external
application launch/UWP frame identity, audio controls/startup policy, IME/screen-reader workflows,
owner-signed update/recovery and global performance budgets (Q-001). Final branding direction remains
Q-002. The original branding is an alpha proposal. See KNOWN_LIMITATIONS and PROJECT_SPEC.

Graphify launcher is unavailable/stale in this session; source/Markdown are current. Obsidian CLI
works while its app runs; docs/ is the vault. Local configuration, exports and owner canvas are not public.
